# hello-mingw

A tiny sample project showing how to create a program for Windows using MSYS2/MinGW.

MSYS2/MinGW ("Minimalist GNU for Windows") is a build environment that can be used to build native Windows binaries in the same way as programs are built on Linux and other Unix-like systems.

Hints for the installation of MSYS2/MinGW on a Windows machine can be found here:
